Each piece uses the params property to store its configurations as outlined in the following pages. An **\*** means the param can be [templated](/reference/templating) by prefixing it with an underscore (`_`) (i.e `address` -> `_address`). You can assume that the templated param will take priority over its not templated version if they are both defined.
