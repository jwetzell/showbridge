The showbridge router's config is entirely controlled by a JSON config file. This file can be made by hand or edited via the web interface included with the launcher. The router WILL NOT start up with an invalid config file. I do provide some starter/example configs to look at to get a general idea of what one entails. 

Resources
- the [JSON Schema](https://docs.showbridge.io/schema/config) used to validate the config file
- good idea to start with [default.json](https://github.com/jwetzell/showbridge/blob/main/sample/config/default.json)
- [random examples](https://github.com/jwetzell/showbridge/blob/main/sample/config/)
- the [demo](https://demo.showbridge.io) site can be used to import/edit/create configs that can be downloaded
